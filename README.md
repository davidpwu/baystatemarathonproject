## Details

This is a public calendar log keeping a record of my workouts for 18 weeks up until the Baystate Marathon on Sunday, October 20, 2019 in Lowell, MA.

Note: Injuries have nixed the training plan but the end goal is still the same. Due to an injury, the current plan is to walk it.

Note: Walk completed.
